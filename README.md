# FSM Simulator with Python (DFSM)
<p>This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and visualize Deterministic Finite State Machines (DFSM). It allows users to define states, transitions, and input strings, then simulates whether the string is accepted or rejected by the DFSM. The program also generates a visual representation of the DFSM using Python libraries.</p>


## Features
